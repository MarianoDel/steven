(i) Find your kernel driver module in use by issuing the below command:
lspci -k | grep -A 3 -i “network”

(ii) Now, use the below command to find out your wifi capabilities (replace ath9k by your kernel driver):
modinfo ath9k | grep ‘depend’
(iii) If the above output includes “mac80211” then it means your wifi card will support the AP mode.

###sin hostapd

The SSID (service set identifier) of the example access point is Northpasture, because that is the view out my window. SSIDs can be up to 32 characters and are case-sensitive.

Debian Configuration
Debian provides several ways to configure wireless adapters. The simplest is to use /etc/network/interfaces. Add this entry, using your own network addresses and ESSID:

auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
address 192.168.1.5
network 192.168.1.0
netmask 255.255.255.0
broadcast 192.168.1.255
gateway 192.168.1.1
wireless_essid Northpasture
wireless_mode Master

You can put any iwconfig command in this file, in the format wireless_[command] [value], except nick.
